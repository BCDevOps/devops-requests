## DevOps Requests:
To get started on the DevOps platform, you and your team will need access to certain resources. This is the place to request for them.

### In a nutshell:
We are using this GitHub repository to manage the requests. Each request will be in a _GitHub Issue_.

### How to create a request:
- Go to the [Issues page](https://github.com/bcgov/devops-requests/issues)
- Create an issue based on a _Issue Template_ that match your need. **NOTE**: To enable automation in this process, we ask you to follow the instructions and format according to the templates. For any contact information required, please only provide  business contact information.
- Once a request has been created, the provisioning process will start. We will post updates on the _GitHub Issue_.


### Request types:
We provide the following request types:

1. [OpenShift Project Set](https://github.com/bcgov/devops-requests/issues/new?template=openshift_project_request.md)
