## DevOps Requests

We aim to empower teams to fulfill their own requirements and solve their own problems as much as possible!
However, practically speaking, there are always going to be certain tasks that require elevated privileges to perform.
That's where DevOps Requests comes in! Click on `Issues` above to get started!

These tickets are templated and quite formal, because the vast majority of such requests are going to be a very normal part of
our every-day work. Because of this, many of these permissions-related tasks have been automated.
If you came here expecting to find a ticket to perform a certain task and that task is missing, that might be because the task
has been automated by a tool! We've added links to those relevant tools as part of the list of templates where possible.

If you cannot find a ticket or automated tool relevant to your needs, check the FAQ below. 
If that doesn't answer your question, head back over to the list of Issue Templates. There, you'll find a template called
`New Request Type`. That is a ticket where you can request that we add a template for the type of request you're looking for.

## Request FAQs

### How do I get access to Artifactory?

Find out more about your account and how to use it on the [DevHub](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Artifact-Repositories)
