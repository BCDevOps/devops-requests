## Step 0
**Is your repository on `bcgov` GitHub Organization?**
We have install SonarCloud on `bcgov` GitHub Organization for application teams to use. Only repositories inside the bcgov GitHub Organization are supported through this request.

**Are you the admin user of the GitHub repositories?**
The request requires a repository administrator to make the request. The requestor will be assigned as the SonarCloud repository admin. Requests from a non-admin user will be closed.
