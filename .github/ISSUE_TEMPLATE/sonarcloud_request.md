## Step 0
**Is your repository on `bcgov` GitHub Organization?**
We have installed SonarCloud on `bcgov` GitHub Organization for application teams to use. Only repositories inside the bcgov GitHub Organization are supported through this request.

**Are you the admin user of the GitHub repositories?**
The request requires a repository administrator to make the request. The requestor will be assigned as the SonarCloud repository admin. Requests from a non-admin user will be closed.

## Step 1
Login to SonarCloud console with your GitHub account https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/bcgov-sonarcloud/projects. Double check at https://sonarcloud.io/account/organizations to make sure `bcgov` GitHub organization is the current org. For debugging, please check if you are a member of bcgov GitHub Organization.

* GitHub repositories to add to SonarCloud:
* New Code Definition: (Refer to [SonarCloud's documentation on the possible values for this field](https://docs.sonarcloud.io/improving/new-code-definition/))



## Step 3
To invite other team members onto sonarcloud, make sure the users have completed Step 1. The SonarCloud repository admin user could further assign roles.
