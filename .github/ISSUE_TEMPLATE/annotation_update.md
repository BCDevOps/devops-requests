## Step 0
**Are you the product owner or technical lead?**
If not, you will need to ask one of those two people to make this request.

If you're looking to update the product owner or technical lead information, the person *currently* listed as product owner or technical lead needs to make this request, rather than the new person.


## Step 1
Make sure no duplicated request exists, search here:
https://github.com/BCDevOps/devops-requests/issues


## Step 2
What annotations/labels need to be changed? (Select all that apply)
- [ ] Product Owner
- [ ] Technical Steward
- [ ] Security Contacts
- [ ] Other Critical Contacts (contact info for other stakeholders such as members of IMB, Architecture, Privacy, etc groups that are interested in receiving comms related to this project sets.
- [ ] Product Group (an optional label that can be used to group together OpenShift Project Sets that share a business function (e.g. Platform Services project sets are labeled as part of "Platform Services" product group.  The value for this label should be determined by the organization/ministry/branch/team that owns the Project Set)
