## Removing Access

If you are removing access please **provide responses to all the steps below**. All questions are mandatory.

### Step 1

**Are you the Technical Lead?**
If not, you need to ask your team's Technical Lead role to make this request on your behalf. 
This person must already be a member of the bcgov GitHub Organization in order for us to process this request.

If you are a technical lead and you've come here to request access for yourself, please go ahead and create this ticket, and then 
contact @mitovskaol (Olena Mitovska) with a link to the ticket so she can approve it.

### Step 2
Fill out the following fields

* Project Name:
* Technical Lead Github ID:
* GitHub Org: bcgov, BCDevops, or private
* GitHub ID: @
* Reason for removal:


**Note** that the Platform Services Team will be removing GitHub Org access **automatically** for users that are not active for six months. Once the access has been removed, a new `Access Request` has to be made by the product owner.
