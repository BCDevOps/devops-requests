## Step 0

**Are you looking for access to the Openshift Console?**
Please note that this ticket is to request membership in our GitHub Organization used for sharing the many open-source projects ongoing at BCGov.
Typically, membership is required for those employees and contractors who need the ability to create new repositories there.
This ticket does not grant access to Openshift! There's another ticket template for that!

**Are you the Technical Lead?**
If not, you need to ask your team's Technical Lead role to make this request on your behalf. 
This person must already be a member of the bcgov GitHub Organization in order for us to process this request.

If you are a technical lead and you've come here to request access for yourself, please go ahead and create this ticket, and then 
contact @mitovskaol (Olena Mitovska) with a link to the ticket so she can approve it.

**Do you actually need the team member to be a member of the organization?**
Often, it works just fine to have a team member as a Collaborator on your repository, without them being a member of 
the `bcgov` GitHub organization. Before submitting this request, consider whether you could simply invite your team 
member to contribute as a Collaborator.  
Instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository).


## Step 1
Visit DevHub for detailed instruction on creating a request:
https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Getting-Started-on-the-DevOps-Platform/How-to-request-new-GitHub-user-access-or-repository-creation

## Step 2
Make sure no duplicated request exists, search here:
https://github.com/BCDevOps/devops-requests/issues


## Step 4
Are you requesting to:
- [x] Invite a user
- [ ] Remove a user


## Step 5
Fill out the following fields

* Project Name: 
* GitHub Org: bcgov or private
* Full Name: 
* GitHub ID: @
* GitHub Account 2FA Confirmed: yes or no
* Email address: 
* Organization: 
* Project Role: 
* GitHub Team to Join (if exists): 
* Existing GitHub Repo: 


**Note** that the platform services team will be removing GitHub Org access for users that are not active for six months. Once the access has been removed, a new `Access Request` has to be made by the product owner.
