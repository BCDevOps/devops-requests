Use the [Common hosted Single Sign on (CSS) App](https://bcgov.github.io/sso-requests/). If you are looking for integration for IDIR login the process is completely self-serve and takes only minutes. You will need an IDIR to log in and you should be a product owner, product admin, or team lead for a project. Once the automated provisioning is complete, your client details will be available securely through the web app (*)

(*) Note for BCeID Requests The Pathfinder SSO team will provision your DEV and TEST clients right away. You will be provided the client name and secret for each environment via a secure channel. The PROD client will be provisioned upon approval from the IDIM team.
