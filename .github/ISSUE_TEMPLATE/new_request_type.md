https://github.com/BCDevOps/devops-requests/issues

Make sure you have read the [FAQ](https://github.com/BCDevOps/devops-requests/).


## Step 2
Please answer the following questions about the new request type:

1. **What is it?** Please provide an overview of what the request should do.
2. **Why should this be a new request type?** A good rule of thumb: Does this involve something you don't have the permissions to do? If the answer yes, you're probably good to go ahead!
3. **What information is required to fulfill this request?** Do you best here - the Platform Services team can help if you're not sure!
4. **What is the end result?** Please provide plenty of details about what the end result should look like.
